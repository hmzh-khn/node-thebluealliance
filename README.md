# node-thebluealliance

node-thebluealliance is a node.js wrapper library for [The Blue Alliance v2 API](http://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs). See the v2 API page for more information on what data can be returned.

This app uses The Blue Alliance's [post-2013 event codes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApRO2Yzh2z01dExFZEdieV9WdTJsZ25HSWI3VUxsWGc#gid=0).


### Installation

First install [node](http://nodejs.org). Then:

```sh
$ npm install thebluealliance
```

This will download node-thebluealliance to the local `node_modules` folder, from which it can be imported with `require`.

### **Notes on the API**

- Arguments
  - `frc_id` refers to the number assigned to each team by FIRST (i.e. 1540, 254, etc.)
  - `event_id` refers to The Blue Alliance's [post-2013 event codes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApRO2Yzh2z01dExFZEdieV9WdTJsZ25HSWI3VUxsWGc#gid=0)

- **CONSISTENT ACROSS EVERY FUNCTION:** In node's style, all callbacks will receive an `error` object as the first argument. A null `error` object indicates a successful request. The second argument in the callback will contain unchanged queried data from The Blue Alliance. The Blue Alliance data models are available under the Models sections of the [API webpage](http://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs).

#### callback(*err*, *data*)

##### err

type: `null` or `Error Object`

##### data

Queried data returned by The Blue Alliance


- **CONSISTENT ACROSS EVERY FUNCTION:** The year argument is always optional and will always default to the current year. For example, calling

```js
tba.getTeamsAtEvent('arc', callback);
```

is the same as calling

```js
tba.getTeamsAtEvent('arc', (new Date()).getFullYear(), callback);
```

#### year
type: `number`
default: current year

The year for which data will be returned.

### initTBA(*identifier*, *description*, *version_number*)

```js
var initTBA = require('thebluealliance');
var tba = initTBA('node-thebluealliance','Node.js wrapper library for the TBA v2 API','1.1.1');

// or as a shortcut

var tba = require('thebluealliance')('node-thebluealliance','Node.js wrapper library for the TBA v2 API','1.1.1');
```

The Blue Alliance v2 API requires a custom `X-TBA-App-Id` header in order to accept requests. Calling initTBA allows node-thebluealliance to retain this header for the duration of the library's use. Calling `initTBA` returns the `tba` object, which contains all of the methods required to retrieve data from The Blue Alliance.

#### identifier

Type: `String`

Name or organization of the user.

#### description

Type: `String`

Description of the application requesting data from The Blue Alliance.

#### version_number

Type: `String` or `Number`

## Support
- [bug reports](https://github.com/khanh111/node-thebluealliance/issues)



## To-Do List

- more clarity in documentation
- add better example code
- tests w/ [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)
- ability to pass in more variants of ids/years (i.e. `'2014orore'` instead of `getEvent('orore',2014)`)

## Upcoming functionality improvements

- methods that allow analysis of certain data subsets (maybe a separate library for this)
- data caching for things that are unlikely to change
  - for this one, limitations due to TBA API (can't get data subsets easily)
